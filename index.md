open-eid is a native plugin for the web to make e-ID card reading and signing easier.

## Download

You can download a Mac Pre-release
[here](https://github.com/michael79bxl/open-eid/raw/master/release/Open-eID.dmg)

You can download a Windows Pre-release soon

## Requirements

- Windows or Mac OS
- Middleware (for Belgium, download [here](https://eid.belgium.be/)) and/or smartcard driver
- Browser compatible with native URL or Chrome Native Messaging extension

## Native URL

The native app can be called using a special `open-eid:` URL scheme followed by the URL used to redirect e-ID data.

Sample: `open-eid:https://michael79bxl.github.io/open-eid/src/url_test.html`

The data is sent to the redirection URL fragment as an URL encoded JSON object after `#`.

Each value in the JSON array is also URL encoded.

*Right now, the redirection URL is loaded using the default browser.

Future releases will open the currently running browser and will only support HTTPS redirection URL.*

## Chrome extension

In order for the chrome extension to work, the native app must be launched once.

On Mac OS, the native app must be installed in /Applications.

The Chrome extension is available
[here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-eid/cgdhcnihnfegipidedmkijjkbphakcjo)
on the Chrome Web Store
